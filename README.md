# Biometric Staff Attendance System

## Overview

The Biometric Staff Attendance System is a fingerprint-based attendance and time tracking solution designed to accurately record staff presence using biometric verification.

The system replaces manual attendance methods with a secure biometric workflow that ensures each attendance record is tied to the physical presence of a registered staff member. It focuses on correctness, data integrity, and controlled access in institutional environments.

This project was implemented as a real-world case study within an academic institution and reflects practical constraints such as staff volume, reporting needs, and hardware integration.

## Problem Statement

Traditional attendance systems present several challenges:

- Manual sign-in sheets can be altered
- Staff impersonation is possible
- Arrival and departure times can be manipulated
- Attendance records are difficult to audit and analyze
- Payroll and reporting rely on unreliable data

This system addresses these issues by enforcing biometric authentication for all attendance actions.

## Key Features

- Fingerprint-based clock-in and clock-out
- Secure staff enrollment with biometric data
- Accurate date and time recording
- Attendance history tracking
- Admin dashboard for staff management
- Daily and monthly attendance reports
- Prevention of duplicate and fraudulent entries

## My Role

I handled the full development of the system, including:

- System setup and structure
- Biometric enrollment and verification logic
- Attendance processing and data handling
- Admin features and reporting
- Testing and validation

---

## System Architecture

The system follows a centralized desktop-based architecture with biometric authentication as the entry point for all attendance operations.

A detailed breakdown is provided in the `architecture.md` file.
